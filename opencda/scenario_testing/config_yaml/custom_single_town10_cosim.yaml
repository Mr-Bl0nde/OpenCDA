  Content: This is the scenario testing configuration file for single vehicle full-stack system in town07 with co-simulation

# First define the basic parameters of the vehicles

vehicle_base:
  sensing:
    perception:
      activate: true # when not activated, objects positions will be retrieved from server directly
      camera:
        visualize: 4 #4 # how many camera images need to be visualized. 0 means no visualization for camera. DOES/DOES NOT affect perception, only whether the cameras are visualized for you as simulation is running. Disabling speeds up simulation.
        num: 4 # how many cameras are mounted on the vehicle. Maximum 3(frontal, left and right cameras)
        # relative positions (x,y,z,yaw) of the camera. len(positions) should be equal to camera num
        positions:
          - [2.5, 0, 1.0, 0]
          - [0.0, 0.3, 1.8, 100]
          - [0.0, -0.3, 1.8, -100]
          - [-2.0, 0.0, 1.5, 180]
      lidar:
        visualize: false # DOES/DOES NOT affect perception, only whether the lidar sensors are visualized for you as simulation is running. Disabling speeds up simulation.

    localization:
      activate: true # when not activated, ego position will be retrieved from server directly
      debug_helper:
        show_animation: false # whether to show real-time trajectory plotting
  
  map_manager:
    visualize: true # Whether to visualize a rasterized version of the map (BEV bird's eye view window).
    activate: true # Disabled BEV rasterized view to cut down on processing time. DOES NOT affect perception processing. 

  behavior:
    ignore_traffic_light: false # whether to ignore traffic light
    collision_time_ahead: 2.0 # used for collision checking
    local_planner:  # trajectory planning related
      debug: true # whether to draw future/history waypoints
      debug_trajectory: true # whether to draw the trajectory points and path

# define sumo simulation setting for traffic generation
sumo:
  port: ~
  host: ~
  gui: true
  client_order: 1
  step_length: ${world.fixed_delta_seconds}


# define scenario. In this scenario, only a single CAV will be spawned
scenario:
  single_cav_list: # this is for merging vehicle or single cav without v2x
    - name: cav1
      spawn_position: [-27.20,24.95, 0.3, 0, 0, 0]
      destination: [80, 24.95, 0.3]
      v2x:
        communication_range: 45
      behavior:
        local_planner:
          debug_trajectory: false
          debug: false
